# Grönwall's Lemma...A Proof

Here's a proof of Grönwall's Inequality.

**Theorem (Grönwall's Inequality) :**
Let $\beta$ and $u$ be two continuous functions from $\left[a,b\right]$ to $\mathbb{R}_+$. If $u$ is differentiable and satisfies :

$$u'(t) \leq \beta(t)u(t)dt$$

Then : 

$$u(t) \leq u(a)\exp(\int_{a}^{t}\beta(t)dt)$$

**Proof:**
Let $\delta$ be a positive real number and let $f$ be the real-valued function on $\left[a,b\right]$ defined by :
$$f(t)=(u(a)+\delta)\exp\left(\int_a^t\beta(t)dt\right)$$
Thus $\forall t\in \mathbb{R}$,
$$f(t) = u(a)+\delta+\int_a^t\beta(t)f(t)dt$$
It is clear that $f(a)>u(a)$. If we suppose that there exists a point in the interval $\left[a,b\right]$ where the value of $u$ is greater than the value of $f$ then the set $\{x \in \left[a,b\right];\; f(x) = u(x)\}$, which is compact, would admit a minimum, let's denote it by $m$. Thus :
$$\forall x\in \left[a,m\right[,\; f(x)>u(x)$$
That implies :
$$u(a)+\delta + \int_a^m\beta(t)f(t)dt > u(a)+ \int_a^m\beta(t)u(t)dt> u(a)+ \int_a^mu'(t)dt$$
And Thus $f(m)>u(m)$ which is a clear contradiction. We conclude that :
$$\forall \delta >0, \; \forall t\in \left[a,b\right],\; u(t) < (u(a)+\delta)\exp\left(\int_a^t\beta(t)dt\right)$$
By taking the limit when $\delta\longrightarrow 0$ we find :
$$\boxed{u(t) \leq u(a)\exp(\int_{a}^{t}\beta(t)dt)}$$
