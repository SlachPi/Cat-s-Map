<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I finished my master degree in mathematics this year. I started this project to occupy my self during this summer. My favourite subjects are symplectic geometry and hamilonian mechanics. My master thesis was about that (more specifically about Liouville-Arnold Theorem).</p>
<p>I do genuinely like mathematics in general and thats why you will find in this blog articles about group theory, galois theory, number theory as well as new proofs of elementary theorems or materials I used for teaching.</p>
<p>I also like programming a lot. Programming was part of my life since I was a kid and way before I got interested in mathematics. My favorite programming language is still C and most of the code in this blog is written in C-like C++. Well… I also like to use Python for some projects.</p>
