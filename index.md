# Welcome To My Page !

My name is Farouk. I started this website to be some sort of repository for my technical writings. My main interests are mathematics and programming.

> I would like you to understand that I consider Mathematics more as a question of how rather than a question of what. That is I consider it as the art and science of reasoning as effectively as possible.
