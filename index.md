# Welcome To My Page !

my name is Farouk. I am a phd student in mathematics. I started this website to be some sort of repository for my technical writings. My main interests are mathematics and programming. The intersection of Mathematics and Computer science is what interests me the most.

> I would like you to understand that I consider Mathematics more as a question of how rather than a question of what. That is I consider it as the art and science of reasoning as effectively as possible.
